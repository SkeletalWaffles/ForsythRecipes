## Forsyth Recipes

This is a fun recipe database in ReactJS (using the NextJS framework) that my brother Jared helped me with! Now, we have moved on to using his [Foood](https://github.com/jaredly/local-first/tree/master/examples/foood) project instead, and I'm having a fun time contributing to that :).
