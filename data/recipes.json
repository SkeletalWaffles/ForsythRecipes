This is half whole wheat. I'll be working on a more whole wheat version next. (I first heard of this from a Nov. 8 2006 NYT article.)</p><p></p><p>3/4 lb. whole white wheat flour (about 2 1/4 c.)</p><p>3/4 lb. white bread flour (about 2 1/4 c.)</p><p>shy 1/2 t. instant yeast</p><p>shy 2 t. salt</p><p>2 1/4 - 2 1/2 cups water</p><p></p><p>In a large container with lid, mix dry ingredients, stir in water. Make sure to get dry pockets from the bottom. Cover, not airtight, and leave on counter 12 to 18 hours (longer time preferred).  Here's how I did it this most recent time. We let it rise from evening Monday to about 3 pm the next day. I preheated to 450, then floured very well my pastry cloth, and poured the dough out onto it, sifting some flour on, and using the sides of the cloth to turn the dough so it had a floury surface everywhere. I covered it with the one side of the cloth and tucked the edges in so it could rest while the top oven heated, with the small roasting pan inside. I heated the lid, too, but the oven is too small for it to fit when on the pan, so that wasn't necessary. </p><p>When the oven was heated I sprinkled some cornmeal over the dough. I pulled the pan out and put it on the stove, sprinkling some cornmeal in it, too. I then lifted the cloth with the dough and sort of tipped the dough off into the hot pan, and with hotpads sort of shook the pan to settle it in. A smear of wet dough slid down one inner edge and began to cook there. I put it in and baked it for 30 minutes, then maybe 15 more. Internal temp was above 190 at that point. We let it cool a lot before cutting so it didn't \"pill.\" It rose nice and high. </p><p>Now back to the original directions:</p><p></p><p>The source recipe then describes a second rise, etc. but I've been making it without. Preheat oven and a cast iron skillet, dutch oven or small enamel roasting pan (11-12\" interior length) to 450. In a roaster oven, this takes about 10 minutes (we bake on the porch in the summer). A home oven might take 30 minutes. Take pan out, uncover, sprinkle with cornmeal (you may need to spray the perimeter with oil, but try it without the first time), and using a rubber scraper, pour dough into hot pan. Cover, bake 30 minutes. Uncover and bake 10-20 more (in the roaster oven 10 is enough). It's best to let this cool, though that meets with loud protests. If you like, don't wash out the rising container, and use it again soon for a bit of sourdough start action.</p><p></p><p>Notes from Spain: </p><p>12 oz whole wheat flour (about 350 g)</p><p>12 oz all purpose flour (about 350 g)</p><p>shy 1/2 t. yeast</p><p>2 t. sea salt</p><p>2 1/4 to 2 1/2 c. water</p><p>Mixed and left overnight about 12 hours and stirred it down. About 2 hours later, I heated the oven to 230 C, and oiled the blue enameled pot at about halfway up the sides, sprinkling cornmeal, and semola de trigo over the bottom and sizes. I shook on a little bit of sea salt, too. After about 15 minutes of preheating, I sprinkled the top of the dough with some flour and carefully scraped the dough into the pan, which I hadn't preheated. I put it in on the bottom rack, covered, for about 35 minutes, then uncovered it for 15, then laid some foil over the center for another 5 or so minutes. </p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20110725","modified":"20200516"},"Algerian Flatbread: \"To be eaten with lamb\"":{"title":"Algerian Flatbread: \"To be eaten with lamb\"","body":"<p>In our Healthy Bread in 5 minutes a day cookbook there's a recipe for Msemmen, or Algerian flatbread. I did a version today in Germany that was very interesting. I made a three-cup flour recipe of bread dough using part whole wheat, part whole spelt, part all purpose flour and part whitish spelt flour. with about a t. yeast and a teaspoon salt, plus some sunflower oil, it took about a cup of warmed liquid (broccoli cooking water this time).</p><p></p><p>I divided the dough in two, and rolled half out into a thin circle. On that I spread this mixture:</p><p></p><p>1 T. extra virgin olive oil</p><p>1 t. ground coriander</p><p>1/2 t. cayenne pepper</p><p>1 t. chana dhal powder</p><p>1/2 t. paprika</p><p>1/2 t. Chinese 5 spice powder</p><p>1/2 t. salt, which I might have preferred to be a little less</p><p></p><p>I spread that mixture over the dough round to within about half an inch of the edges, or a little more. Then starting from one edge, I rolled the dough up, or sort of folded over by inches, then made a coil of that tube, then flattened that and rounded it with my hands, then floured the counter a little and rolled the dough out again. When making this at home, I have done it large, and cooked it in our largest skillet which might be 14 inches across. Here the biggest skillet is 23 cm, or not quite 10 inches. So I rolled the dough out smaller and thicker than I'm used to, and cooked it slightly differently. I heated the cast iron pan, then poured in a generous glug of olive oil to coat the bottom, then placed the bread circle in and let it cook for a while, and spread olive oil on the top with a pastry brush, shook the pan a little, turned the dough, shook some more, watched that the heat wasn't too high (I began medium to medium high, and lowered as I went along). I also covered the pan, shaking it back and forth some, turned the dough later, etc. It got nice browned places, but no black places. I was concerned it wouldn't cook through because of the thickness, but it was fine. And the bread had lots of layers, and was very good. We served it with a sort of hummus we made from brown chickpeas and lots of other fun things, and had cut raw vegetables, and a waldorf salad. </p><p></p><p>The second round of dough I used something closer to the spice mixture of the original recipe, which is here:</p><p></p><p>1 T. extra virgin olive oil (the original recipe calls for 3 T., but that just runs out and makes an impressive mess)</p><p>1 t. cumin</p><p>1 t. turmeric</p><p>1 t. paprika</p><p>1/2 t. cayenne (to taste)</p><p>1/4 t. kosher salt, plus a bit more for sprinkling later</p><p></p>","creator":"YourName","created":"20200409","modified":"20201007"},"Aloo Curry":{"title":"Aloo Curry","body":"<p>1 T. green chili paste</p><p>1/2 onion, fry together</p><p>cardomom pods, opened</p><p>coriander seed,</p><p>poppy seed</p><p>curry powder</p><p>garam masala</p><p>garlic</p><p>cumin (frying together)</p><p>a cup of potato (nuked)</p><p>a cup of cauliflower (nuked)</p><p>1/2 cup frozen peas</p><p>1 cup ish of water</p><p>salt (chili paste has some)</p><p>1/2 cup yogurt</p><p>10 ounces of tofu ish (add once the liquid is all mixed)</p><p>thicken with a little flour</p><p>You could  fry some meat to use, too. </p><p>So frying with paste, onion, then spices, add chunky stuff, then add liquids, thicken as needed.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20171017","modified":null},"Aloo Naan":{"title":"Aloo Naan","body":"<p>This recipe is from ifood tv, http://www.ifood.tv/recipe/aloo-naan.  I made these March 27, 2013, with half whole wheat flour, only rising for about 1 hour, using 1 1/2 c. hot water to 3/4 plus 1/3 c. potato pearls for the filling. I also only had ground cumin, and I had frozen cilantro cubes that had a little oil and some lime, and I used two. This turned out very tasty. I put the pizza stone very low in the oven, and the cast iron grill above on a rack, but it made it really hard to get them in. I'll try adjusting that so it's less perilous.</p><p></p><p>To prepare the dough:</p><p> </p><p>All Purpose flour (Plain flour or maida) – 2 cups</p><p> Active dry yeast - 1 teaspoon</p><p> Salt - 1 teaspoon</p><p> Sugar - 1 teaspoon</p><p> Baking soda – a pinch</p><p> Oil - 2 tablespoons</p><p> Yogurt (curd or dahi) - 2 tablespoons</p><p> Lukewarm water - 3/4 cup or use as needed</p><p></p><p> For the potato filling:</p><p> Potatoes - 2 numbers, medium size</p><p> Salt - 1 teaspoon or adjust to taste</p><p> Cumin seeds (Jeera) - 1/2 teaspoon</p><p> Mango powder (amchoor) - 1/2 teaspoon</p><p> Green pepper - 1 number, chopped</p><p> Cilantro (hara dhania) - 2 tablespoons, chopped</p><p> Garam masala (optional) - 1/2 teaspoon</p><p> </p><p>Also required:</p><p> Oil - 2 tablespoon</p><p> Clear butter or ghee - 2 teaspoon, to butter the Naan</p><p> All Purpose flour - 1/4 cup for rolling</p><p></p><p>Directions</p><p>GETTING READY</p><p>1. Preheat the oven to 500°F with baking rack for about thirty minutes or until rack is hot. Using a rack helps naan to get same heat as in a clay tandoor.</p><p></p><p>MAKING</p><p>2. To make the dough: Dissolve yeast in 2 tablespoons of lukewarm water and let it sit for 10 minutes or until the mixture becomes frothy.</p><p>3. Add sugar, salt and baking soda to the flour and mix well.</p><p>4. Combine oil and yogurt mix it well, this will become crumbly dough.</p><p>5. Add the water-yeast mixture; add water as needed to make the dough firm. Note that after dough rises, it will become a little softer.</p><p>6. Knead until the dough is smooth. Cover the dough with damp cloth and keep it in a warm place for 3-4 hours. The dough should almost double in volume.</p><p>7. To prepare the filling: Boil 2 medium potatoes until they are tender.</p><p>8. Once cooked, drain the water and let the potatoes cool down. Note: Do not cool the potatoes under running water. Potatoes will absorb the water and become soft.</p><p>9. Peel the skin off and mash the potatoes.</p><p>10. Add green pepper, cilantro, cumin seeds, mango powder, garam masala, and salt to the mashed potatoes and mix it well.</p><p>11. To make the naan: Knead the dough for about two minutes and divide the dough into six equal parts, and divide the potato mix in six parts. Potato mix should be little smaller then dough balls.</p><p>12. Roll the dough into a 3-inch circle. Place one potato ball in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the potato filling. Proceed to make all six balls.</p><p>13. Let the filled balls settle for 3 to 4 minutes before rolling them.</p><p>14. Next turn the oven to high broil.</p><p>15. Before putting the Naan in oven, oil your palms with oil and flip naan between your palms and place onto your baking rack into the oven.</p><p>16. You can place about 2 to 3 naan on the baking rack at a time. The naan will take about 2 to 3 minutes to cook, depending upon your oven. After the naan is baked, it should become golden brown color on top.</p><p>17. Take naan out of the oven and brush lightly with clear butter (ghee).</p><p>18. Wait for 2 to 3 minutes before baking the next naan. It gives oven the chance to get heated again to max.</p><p>19. If baking rack is not available use baking sheet. After naan is cooked from top turn them over to cook from other side.</p><p></p><p>SERVING</p><p>20. Serve the naan hot with dal makhni, raita, chola or palak paneer.

Sara is here, and I don't have a pie plate, and our oven is iffy, so I didn't want to invest in a full scale project, so I wanted something a little simpler. Ina Garten at food network had a nice recipe. It ended up a little burnt, either because of the sugar in the crust and topping, or the oven unpredictableness, etc., but I think it's promising. I might cut the sugar in the crust, maybe doing something closer to traditional pie crust. I used the recipe just as written, except that I added 1/4 c. quick oats to the topping. Watch it so it doesn't get too brown.</p><p>Here are the ingredients:</p><p></p><p>1 cup all-purpose flour</p><p>2 tablespoons granulated or superfine sugar</p><p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p><p>1/4 pound (1 stick) very cold unsalted butter, diced</p><p>2 tablespoons ice water</p><p>For the filling:</p><p>1 1/2 pounds McIntosh, Macoun, or Empire apples (3 large) (I've used golden delicious, too)</p><p>1/4 teaspoon grated orange zest</p><p>1/4 cup flour</p><p>1/4 cup granulated or superfine sugar</p><p>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</p><p>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</p><p>1/8 teaspoon ground allspice (or a bit of cloves and nutmeg)</p><p>4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) cold unsalted butter, diced (more or less)</p><p></p><p>For the pastry, place the flour, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Pulse a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse 12 to 15 times, or until the butter is the size of peas. With the motor running, add the ice water all at once through the feed tube. Keep hitting the pulse button to combine, but stop the machine just before the dough becomes a solid mass. Turn the dough onto a well-floured board and form into a disk. Wrap with plastic and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</p><p></p><p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. (My oven was unpredictable, so I had the heat lower, maybe not quite 400, and I baked for longer.)</p><p></p><p>Flour a rolling pin and roll the pastry into an 11-inch circle on a lightly floured surface. Transfer it to a baking sheet. (Or you could flour a silicone sheet, and then you wouldn't have to move it, but getting the edges loose so they can fold up might be tough.)</p><p></p><p>For the filling, peel, core, and cut the apples into 8ths. Cut each wedge into 3 chunks. Toss the chunks with the orange zest. (I cut apples much smaller, and I mixed the zest in with the other ingredients below.) Cover the tart dough with the apple chunks leaving a 1 1/2-inch border.</p><p></p><p>Combine the flour, sugar, salt, cinnamon, and allspice in the bowl of a food processor fitted with a steel blade. Add the butter and pulse until the mixture is crumbly. Pour into a bowl and rub it with your fingers until it starts holding together. Sprinkle evenly on the apples (I tossed the apples with it so it was mixed throughout). Gently fold the border over the apples to enclose the dough, pleating it to make a circle. (I didn't have enough to do more than just come part way up the sides.)</p><p></p><p>Bake the crostata for 20 to 25 minutes, until the crust is golden and the apples are tender. Allow to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature. </p><p></p><p>In 2019 I made this with only about 18 oz apples, other filling ingredients the same. One time I also increased the crust by half. It was a warm day, and though I chilled it, the dough was super hard to handle. In similar circumstances I'd probably do it as press-in dough. I did it in two loaf pans, sort of just up the two long sides a bit, and folded a bit over the filling. Also, when I increased the dough ingredients, I didn't increase the sugar, and it was fine. I'd also consider rolling the circle out onto parchment paper, and then if it stuck, I could just wrap the paper up around it and let it bake like that. Even with all the difficulty of managing the crust dough, the taste was worth it. But this sort of thing could also be made with another sort of crust recipe, I'm sure.</p><p></p><p>http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ina-garten/apple-crostata-recipe.html</p><p></p><p>Germany 2019 notes: I did part oil in the crust because we were out of butter. I rolled crust between parchment paper and plastic wrap, and that worked well, though it didn't come away from the paper easily to wrap up around the apples. The apples were from a nearby tree, and were quite hard, so it took a long time to bake them soft enough. I also didn't read carefully and didn't mix the butter with the dry ingredients for the topping, but stirring them together worked okay.</p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20160327","modified":"20190921"},"Apple Filo Pie with Maple and Pecans":{"title":"Apple Filo Pie with Maple and Pecans","body":"<p>Give this a look:</p><p>http://drizzleanddip.com/2013/02/20/apple-phyllo-pie-with-pecans-and-maple</p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20130408","modified":null},"Apple Foam Coffee Cake":{"title":"Apple Foam Coffee Cake","body":"<p>We're making fresh apple juice this year, given a bumper crop on Mom's tree.

She didn't have lemon zest so I used a bit of lemon essential oil; lime juice instead of lemon juice; regular sugar for sprinkling; chopped almonds instead of flaked; no almond flavoring. I used a packet of vanilla sugar instead of vanilla. I used a cup of frozen red mixed berries for the blueberries and 3 cups of fresh blackberries. Combo of flours, including some spelt flour, whole wheat and some something that's a sort of whole wheat light. They had no mixer, so I was hand mixing butter and sugar, so obviously didn't beat it for 3 minutes. Overall I followed the recipe fairly closely. I baked it in a 9 x 13 with the bottom element only for about 15 minutes, then the top element too for 5 or 7, then bottom element alone for some more, perhaps a total of 32 or 33 or so. The edges were getting golden brown by the time I took it out. We let it cool for 20 minutes or so, and had it with vanilla ice cream.

Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally at first, then more frequently as the mixture starts to bubble and reduce.</p><p>When mixture has reduced and looks syrupy (about 30 minutes total), stir in lemon juice and zest. Taste and add sugar if necessary. (This depends on how sweet your berries were to begin with.) Cook for 3 minutes longer, stirring frequently to prevent burning. When the jam is thickened and shiny but still slightly runnier than you expect jam to be, take it off the heat; it will continue to thicken as it cools.</p><p>Scrape jam into a bowl or heatproof container, stir in vanilla and let cool to room temperature. Taste and stir in a little more lemon juice if the jam seems very sweet. At this point, the cooled jam can be chilled for up to 1 week.</p><p>Make the dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose and whole-wheat flours, and set aside. In a second bowl and using an electric mixer, beat butter and sugar until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in egg yolks, lemon zest, vanilla, salt and almond extract until combined, then beat in flour mixture.</p><p>Scoop 1/2 cup of the dough into a bowl or container, cover and chill. Transfer remaining dough to a 9- or 10-inch tart pan and use floured fingers to press evenly into bottom and sides. Chill crust in the refrigerator for at least 20 minutes.</p><p>When ready to bake, heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread jam evenly into crust, then using your fingers, crumble reserved 1/2 cup dough over jam. Sprinkle with almonds and Demerara sugar.</p><p>Bake until golden, 38 to 48 minutes. Let cool completely to room temperature before serving.</p><p></p><p>January 2020 Apricot variation: I did the crust as indicated, using a few drops of lemon essential oil instead of zest, and no almond flavoring, also one egg instead of two yokes. Then I used 350 g of my low sugar apricot jam/syrup, plus 50 g. sugar, brought to a boil in the microwave. I used pecans as nuts. I chilled the crust and jam with blobs of crust mix for a while, then added the nuts. This was not as good as the German version; possibly due to wheat vs spelt flour, not as sweet apricot, hard to tell.</p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20190819","modified":"20200405"},"Blackberry Scones":{"title":"Blackberry Scones","body":"<p>I used this link as a source: http://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/270665/blackberry-buttermilk-scones/</p><p></p><p>It turned out like this:</p><p>120 g. whole spelt flour</p><p>120 g. mixed whole wheat flour (sort of \"light\")</p><p>68 g. sugar</p><p>1 t. baking powder</p><p>1/4 t. baking soda</p><p>1/2 t. salt</p><p>100 g. butter</p><p>1/2 c. mix of yogurt and milk (orig called for buttermilk)</p><p>1 egg </p><p>eggwash</p><p>1 cup fresh blackberries, about 130 g.</p><p>coarse sugar, or white sugar</p><p></p><p>I baked at about 400 for roughly 15 minutes.

This recipe isn't sugar free, but it's better than some. This is a half batch, which fits nicely into a pan that can toast in the toaster oven of the summer kitchen on the porch. It's probably best to make it in small batches anyway.</p><p></p><p>35-40 g. melted butter</p><p>30-35 g honey/agave combination</p><p>15-20 g. cocoa powder</p><p>75 g coconut (I used sweetened, because we have it to use up; the tiny ground coconut we usually have might be too small here)</p><p>125 g. nuts and seeds: I used some Brazil nuts, some pecans, some pumpkin seeds and some flax seeds</p><p>1 c. old fashioned oats (these weren't called for in the original recipe; everyone's anti-grain these days, but I thought it would be good, and it was)</p><p></p><p>Combine the butter, sweetener and cocoa well. Mix with the other ingredients and place in a pan, probably 9x9 or 10x12. Bake at about 300 for about 20 minutes; it's a little hard to tell when the coconut is toasted because of the chocolate, but sniffing is helpful. Cool in the pan and break up into chunks. I saw this referred to as a granola, but I'll just be snacking on it. </p><p></p><p>Here's the recipe I based mine on, from the stonesoup blog that sends me emails:</p><p> Chocolatey Coconut Granola</p><p></p><p>Adapted from the ‘I Quit Sugar Chocolate Cookbook‘ by Sarah Wilson.</p><p></p><p>If the thought of chocolate for breakfast gets you excited, I highly recommend starting with this granola. It’s seriously delicious served on top of home made natural yoghurt or coconut yoghurt. And in case you’re wondering, I have chia seed bran in the bottom of the glass in the photo above.</p><p></p><p>Sarah uses rice malt syrup to sweeten many of her recipes. Most good health food stores will stock it, but you could use honey instead. I really love the flavor of rice malt syrup, it’s not super sweet and has a lovely malty slightly carameley flavour. I also love that it’s a natural ingredient produced from brown rice.</p><p></p><p>    75g (3oz) butter or coconut oil</p><p>    3 tablespoons rice malt syrup</p><p>    30g (1/3 cup) cocoa powder, preferably raw</p><p>    150g (5oz) coconut flakes</p><p>    250g (9oz) chopped nuts</p><p></p><p>1. Preheat your oven to 150C (300F).</p><p>2. Melt butter or coconut oil in a small saucepan. Add rice malt syrup and cocoa powder. Stir.</p><p>3. Combine coconut and nuts in a bowl. Stir in the cocoa syrup mixture until the flakes are just coated.</p><p>4. Spread mixture on a baking tray. Bake for 25-30 minutes, stirring every 10 minutes or so. Stop when the coconut is well browned (which can be difficult to tell through the cocoa) or everything tastes roasted and yummy.</p><p>5. Cool and transfer to an airtight container. Will keep for a few months at room temperature.</p><p></p><p>VARIATIONS</p><p>optional additives – Sarah also includes cinnamon (1 teaspoon), chia seeds (2 tablespoons) and cocoa nibs (2 tablespoons) in her recipe. So feel free to add in any or all of these. But honestly I prefer this simple 5 ingredient version.</p><p>different nuts – I used brazil nuts and pecans but feel free to use any nut you like.</p><p>different sweetener / no rice malt syrup – If you can find rice malt syrup or aren’t interested in investing in a new sweetener, feel free to use honey instead. Glucose syrup or dextrose could also be used. Or if you have stevia in the house that’s another option.</p><p>vegan – make sure you use coconut oil instead of the butter.</p><p>nut-free - if you’re catering for nut allergies, you could replace the nuts with extra coconut (just double the amount of coconut and skip the nuts) or use a combo of coconut and seeds such as pumpkin seeds and sunflower seeds – whatever you feel like.</p><p></p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20130606","modified":null},"Chocolate Cream Pie in Spain":{"title":"Chocolate Cream Pie in Spain","body":"<p>13 oz (400 ml) whipping cream</p><p>7 oz (200 gr) chocolate-hazelnut cream, such as Nocilla or Nutella</p><p>3.5 oz (100 gr) dark chocolate bar with at least 70% cocoa</p><p>5 large eggs</p><p>1/3 cup (2.5 oz or 75 gr) granulated sugar</p><p>1.75 oz (50gr) chopped almonds</p><p>4 oz (112 gr) butter</p><p>2 cups crushed Maria crackers (or graham crackers)</p><p>2 egg whites</p><p>cocoa powder (unsweetened) for dusting</p><p></p><p>Place a rack in the center and heat the oven to 360F (180C) degrees.</p><p></p><p>Prepare the filling.

The icing is meant to be quite thick; if you apply it while the loaf is still warm, it will remain soft and gooey. If you apply it once the bread is fully cooled, it will harden to a thick, glossy frosting.

If needed, let cool to the correct temperature before using.</p><p>While the milk heats, in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the dough hook, mix the flour, granulated sugar, yeast and salt to combine. Add the warm milk, butter and egg and mix on low speed until the dough comes together, about 3 minutes. Scrape the bowl well, and mix on medium speed for another 3 minutes.</p><p>Transfer to a lightly greased medium bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let rise until puffy and almost doubled in size, 45 minutes to 1 hour.</p><p>While the dough rises, make the filling: In a medium bowl, whisk the butter and brown sugar until well combined. Whisk in the flour, cinnamon, vanilla and salt until well incorporated.</p><p>When the dough has risen, roll it out into into a rectangle (about 12 by 20 inches) on a lightly floured surface using a lightly floured rolling pin. Spread the filling over the dough in an even layer all the way to the edges. Starting on one of the long sides, tightly roll up the dough crosswise into a 20-inch log. Gently stretch the log to make it about 24 inches long.</p><p>Use a sharp or serrated knife to cut the dough into 16 1 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Arrange the cinnamon rolls in the loaf pan: Place two rows of six pieces each at the bottom of the pan, side-by-side, seam-side down and tightly packed with the swirls facing the ends of the pan. Arrange the remaining four pieces in the center on top of those on the bottom.</p><p>Loosely cover the loaf with plastic wrap and let rise until the dough comes about 1 inch over the top edge of the pan, about 1 hour (it can be more if your room temperature is cooler). Toward the end of the rise time, heat the oven to 350 degrees.</p><p>Make an egg wash by lightly beating one egg and 1 tablespoon water together. Brush the loaf with the egg wash, then bake until the loaf has an internal temperature of 200 degrees, about 50 to 55 minutes. The loaf will brown quickly; tent it with foil after 20 to 25 minutes for the remainder of baking time.</p><p>While the loaf bakes, make the glaze: In a medium bowl, whisk the confectioners’ sugar, cream and vanilla to combine. The mixture should be thick, more like a frosting than a glaze. Add more cream if needed to achieve a smooth texture. Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the wrap into the surface of the frosting so the surface doesn’t harden.</p><p>Let the bread cool in the pan for 15 minutes. Use a small offset spatula to loosen the loaf from the short edges of the pan, then lift out the loaf using the parchment paper and cool for at least 30 minutes on a cooling rack before applying the frosting. Spread the frosting in an even layer over the surface of the loaf.</p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20190503","modified":null},"Cinnamon Rolls":{"title":"Cinnamon Rolls","body":"<p>Jon asked for cinnamon rolls, and I asked him how he wanted them to be.

I have a friend who makes toffee, and she says that the quality of butter you use makes a difference; lower moisture is better. I make this with the store brand, and we manage to eat it, but I think I can see the point she's making. When I made it for Christmas 2013, the butter sort of separated into oil and solids, which was weird.</p><p></p><p>Butter 8\" square pan. Spread:</p><p>1 c. chopped walnuts</p><p></p><p>Heat and boil, stirring constantly, in a heavy sauce pan: </p><p>3/4 c. packed brown sugar</p><p>1/2 c. butter</p><p></p><p>Cook until mixture darkens and just begins to smoke, about 7 minutes. Don't get too dark.</p><p>Pour immediately over the nuts. Sprinkle on:</p><p></p><p>1/2 c. semi-sweet chocolate chips, and cover with a cookie sheet to hold in the heat so it melts the chips. Spread with a knife. If desired sprinkle on ground walnuts. Score while still warm. Refrigerate, then break when cool. </p><p></p><p>The Grangers' toffee recipe is this: Spread 1/2 c. chipped almonds in a buttered 9x13 pan. Cook: 1 c. butter (see note above), 1 c. brown sugar; boil exactly 12 minutes, stirring constantly. Mix in 1/2 c. chipped almonds in to toffee, spread onto the nuts in pan. break up 4 standard hershey bars (we'd probably use chips here). Spread chocolate as it melts. Chill and then break into pieces. </p><p></p><p>I recently found a recipe on a site called cooking for engineers. It appeals to me because it's precise and gives clear instructions. You can find it here: http://www.cookingforengineers.com/recipe/159/English-Toffee</p><p></p><p>Here's what I tried:</p><p>340 g. chocolate chips (2 cups)</p><p>400 g. sugar (2 cups)</p><p>60 g. sliced almonds (Lisa doesn't like nuts, so this was for sprinkling on half the batch)</p><p>2 t. vanilla (which I forgot in the tension of the difficulties that follow)</p><p>450 g. butter (if using unsalted, add 1/4 t. salt)</p><p>2 t. water</p><p>In medium saucepan melt the butter, sugar and water, on very low heat. Some suggest keeping the sugar in the middle, to avoid crystals on the sides.</p><p>Then, stir constantly on medium high heat while the water boils off and mixture swells. It will collapse and thicken, temp rising rapidly. At Utah altitudes, 300 degrees is too high. The suggestion is lower target temp by 1 degree for every 500 ft. of altitude above sea level, so that's 9 degrees, as we're at 4700 ft here. </p><p>When the temp is reached (or hard crack stage, more about that here: http://www.cooksinfo.com/hard-crack-stage) remove from heat, stir in vanilla, spread on a silpat sheet in a jelly roll pan, sprinkle with chocolate, let it melt, then spread evenly. Sprinkle with nuts. Robbyn lines her sheets with foil, then lots of toasted nuts, and pours the candy over the top. After the chocolate she sprinkles a few nuts on top of that. Heres was a lot thicker than mine, but that's probably because of all the nuts.</p><p></p><p></p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20130424","modified":"20171211"},"Estonian Kringel":{"title":"Estonian Kringel","body":"<p>Go here to see pictures and the method: http://www.justlovecookin.com/2011/11/estonian-kringel.html and scroll down to see English recipe, which I copied below, with modifications.

So I melted 4 T. butter, let it cool some, stirred in almost a cup of sugar, stirred to cool a bit more, stirred in well-beaten eggs, then 1/4 cup plus 2+ lime juice. Once all mixed, I heated on low heat, stirring constantly, increasing heat a little as necessary until the mixture is a little thicker, and a finger drawn through the curd doesn't fill in.</p><p></p><p>Here's a [[7-minute microwave version.|http://www.pbs.org/parents/kitchenexplorers/2014/05/08/7-minute-lemon-curd-recipe/]] I made it August 13, 2014, and it was nice and easy. I used 2 T. of butter rather than 3, and I probably only had 1/4 c. lemon instead of the 1/3 called for. I've written the recipe out on my blog, and include it here:</p><p></p><p>A Little Lightning-fast Lemon Curd</p><p></p><p>    1 egg</p><p>    1/3 cup sugar (73 grams) </p><p>    1/3 cup (65-75 g) freshly squeezed lemon juice, seeds removed (pulp okay)</p><p>    1 to 3 tablespoons melted butter (14-42 g.)</p><p>    finely grated and chopped zest of one lemon, optional</p><p></p><p>Lately I've been putting the citrus peel in a little chopper with the sugar and blending that very well; it makes it easier to get the zest small, and infuses the sugar with the flavor. I have also used a clean jam jar to melt the butter in (weighed in the jar), and then when the curd is done I store it in that, saving on the washing up.</p><p></p><p>In a microwave-safe bowl (6 to 8 cup size), whisk the egg and sugar until smooth. Gradually whisk in lemon juice, melted butter and zest. Heat on high in microwave for 1 minute. Scrape sides well and stir, then cook at 45-second intervals, scraping and stirring after each. The mixture will swell and bubble (the reason for the big bowl).</p><p></p><p>Cooking time will vary, but it’s likely to be done after 3 or 4 cycles; the lemon curd is ready when it is thick enough to stick to the back of a spoon. It will thicken as it cools. Transfer to a container for storing in the fridge, unless you’ve got a few friends on hand and the makings of some lovely toast, in which case the storage step is likely to be unnecessary. I’ve also had good luck making lime curd using the stove-top recipe, and I assume it would work well to substitute lime juice in this one, too.

Compared to the majority of granola recipes I see, which are often candy for breakfast, this is definitely on the austere end of things, but we like it.

There are notes here for different methods and variations.\t\t</p><p></p><p>1 heaping teaspoon instant dry yeast</p><p>3 cup (1 lb.) whole white wheat flour, or substitute about 2/3 c. bread flour for some of that</p><p>1 heaping teaspoon salt</p><p>1-3 teaspoons sugar or other sweetener, as desired; can be omitted; I usually leave it out</p><p> </p><p>1 ½ to 1 2/3 cup very warm water </p><p>a jigger of oil (1/2 to 1 T.); can be omitted, especially for pizza crust or baguette</p><p>any number of additions: for recent soft pretzel knots I added 2 T. flax seed meal; I often add 2-4 T. of various seeds.</p><p></p><p> Mix dry ingredients in work bowl of a food processor briefly. Warm tap water in microwave up to 1 min 30 seconds, not so hot that it would be uncomfortable to drink (yeast doesn’t like water above about 110 degrees; because it’s mixed with dry ingredients, it can take a bit hotter, but not much). Add a little oil, and pour in a pencil-thick stream while machine is running. Once all liquid is added, begin timing, and process about 1 minute. Dough should collect in a ball around the center post, and have an even consistency (no globs of stiffer dough). Sometimes you need to use a butter knife to cut through it a few times and then process a bit more to get it consistent. You want the dough to be soft, but not too soft. Add a few tablespoons of flour if you need to.</p><p></p><p>If you don't have a food processor, you can do this in a stand mixer, though you'll let the machine knead it for longer, maybe 3 to 5 minutes (I have done this a few times, but don't know the ideal mixing time yet). If you make this by hand, the mixing order is usually different: begin with the liquid, stirring in the dry mixture, stirring as you go, and add flour until you get a dough consistency, then knead by hand for about 10 minutes. This is good exercise, and can be very meditative. </p><p></p><p>Whichever way you get there, the next stage is this: turn out onto a floured cloth (I use a pastry cloth that I keep floury and folded in a drawer for the purpose) and toss a few times to dust with flour. Place in a bowl and cover with a clean dish towel (I don’t oil the bowl or cover in plastic as some recommend; it saves effort, seems to work better). Let rise until a wet finger poke doesn’t fill in, 30-50 minutes or so. With wet hand, deflate dough and let rise again (may take a bit less time). Deflate again and toss on floured cloth, shaping as desired. </p><p></p><p>I often make two long baguettes, or two mini-loaves end to end in a 9x5 pan. The advantage of that is that if you’re at all in doubt whether the bread has baked long enough, you can break the loaves apart where they join and examine the crumb to make sure it’s no longer wet or grayish. From observing the outside, loaf is done when it sounds hollow when tapped, slips easily from pan, and springs back when squeezed or poked. These days I use an instant-read thermometer; a reading of 190-200 lets you know it’s done. This dough will also make 16-18 rolls. For pretzel knots, roll into a flat rectangle, use a pizza cutter to cut along the short side in about 3/4\" widths, then once down the center of the long side. You'll probably get about 4 dozen or so. Tie them in a little knot and place on an oiled sheet or a silicone baking sheet.</p><p></p><p>Once dough is shaped, let rise again until double, preheating the oven near the end of the rise. Ovens vary, but I bake my baguettes at 375-400 about 20-25 minutes, loaf 350-375 about 35-40. Hot bread tears well if you must fall upon it, but slicing is another matter, so let it cool a bit before wielding the knife, using a sharp serrated knife and lots of back and forth sawing, hardly any downward pressure.  </p><p> </p><p>If I’ve got cooked pumpkin or mashed potatoes, I add about 1/2 cup, adding water to it to make up the liquid measure, heating as described. I then add a bit more water if needed. I also use leftover oatmeal, yogurt, applesauce, etc. A beaten egg can be added (though be careful not to cook it; just stir into warmed water to make up the liquid measure) which adds richness. If you like, cutting in a few tablespoons of butter is nice for the texture, too, especially for rolls. There are countless variations you can do; your family will be more than happy to help you eat your experiments as you figure out what you all like best!</p><p></p><p>I gave a bread baking class several years ago, and include here some notes from that presentation that may prove helpful.</p><p></p><p>\tI'm passionate about homemade, whole wheat bread, and so am about to make many bold claims and exhortations.  I hope I can inspire you to giving it a try.  To my way of thinking, the value of baking good bread at home outweighs all of the substantial reasons not to, which include yeast phobia and hectic schedules, among others.  Homemade whole wheat bread is a marvelous thing: it communicates caring, it smells irresistible, it tempts people to the table, and nutritionally it's at its best. All well and good, you say, but who has time?  Well, you do, probably: it takes about half an hour, spread out over 3 or 4 hours.  If you never have an at-home stretch of 3 or 4 hours, perhaps you've let your life get too busy.   Rather than wait until life becomes simpler before learning to bake bread, you can use baking bread as a means of making life simpler.  Let it carve out some time for you at home that can't be cut into by other activities (except emergencies, of course: just sling the dough in the fridge and be off, if need be).  The next time the Brownie troop needs to be ferried somewhere, you can say, \"I'm sorry, I can't; I've got bread rising.\"</p><p></p><p>\tMost people are fans of homemade bread, but perhaps you have your doubts about whole wheat bread.  How many of you have ever made or eaten bad whole wheat bread?  I began baking bread in high school, and I told myself it was great, better than anything from a store.  I needed some convincing, because it wasn't really great: it was dense and crumbly and had an off taste to it.  Pessimists might say that that's just the nature of whole wheat bread.  As it happened, the off taste was due to rancid flour, and the dense crumbly texture to insufficient kneading.  I don't always make perfect loaves even now, but there's always good, and sometimes they're sublime.  One thing that causes trouble for people in making whole wheat bread is trying to make it as much like white bread as possible.  I am quite biased, so to me that seems like being disappointed that one can't make fresh squeezed orange juice taste more like Tang.  My goal is to help you make such good whole wheat bread that you and your families will not only eat it because it's good for you but will actually prefer it.  It can be done.</p><p></p><p>\tGreat whole wheat bread comes from fresh ingredients, lots of kneading and plenty of time.  The easy way to do the kneading is in the food processor, but hurrying the bread after that point compromises its texture, flavor and keeping quality.  If that's not a concern, as for pizza crust which will be eaten in a sitting under flavorful topping, you can double the yeast and let it rise only once before rolling out.  Everyone establishes her own routine.  Mine turns out to be, 10 or 15 minutes to mix, rise for 30-60 minutes, punch down, rise about 30 minutes, punch down, shape, rise about 20 minutes, turn on oven, put in ten minutes later, bake about 25-40 minutes.  There is time for errands between risings, or if something comes up, I throw it in the fridge.  </p><p></p><p>The things that make the most difference for me in making really wonderful bread are:</p><p></p><p>Fresh flour.  If you don't have a grinder, those of us who do would be glad for you to visit us.  Also, natural foods stores stock it.</p><p>Hard white spring wheat: it makes lighter bread, more easily digestible, and so is ideal for helping with the transition to whole grain cooking.  Ask me about sources. \t</p><p>Making sure the bread dough has an even consistency. I usually make mine fairly soft. If I'm in doubt, I add liquid until it's a little too wet and then add a few tablespoons of flour until it's back to \"just right\" and can be handled.</p><p>A pastry cloth: 24\" x 24\" should work: I think mine is canvas, but I have used a pillow case in a pinch.  It allows you to make a softer dough, using less flour, with less problem of sticking.</p><p>Two rises before the shaping.  This allows the bread to develop really good texture, flavor and keeping quality.  If the prospect keeps you from wanting to bake, do one rise. </p><p></p><p>Notes on ingredients:</p><p></p><p>Whole grain flours begin losing their nutrients within a short while of grinding, so ideally flour ought to make its way to bread within a day or two.  Flour can be kept from turning rancid, and some of the nutrient loss is slowed if flour is refrigerated or frozen (although I understand that vitamin E doesn't survive freezing).  It will still be worth baking with flour whose vitamin B isn't at its peak, but rancid flour cannot be redeemed, even with butter and honey on the finished slice. </p><p>Yeast bought in bulk is astronomically cheaper, and keeps in the freezer for ages.  warehouse stores have it in pound bricks for a few dollars or so, which is about a 40 fold savings over the grocery store packets.</p><p>You can make good bread without salt, fat, or sweeteners, but it takes some effort, and it beyond the scope of this demonstration.  If those factors are of interest, ask me.</p><p>  </p><p></p><p>I highly recommend the book The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book, by Robertson, Flinders and Godfrey.  It gives very detailed instructions, as well as troubleshooting, and many great recipes.  I have it and can lend it out for short periods of time.</p><p></p>","creator":"Lori Forsyth","created":"20111117","modified":"20141029"},"Lovelight Chiffon Cake":{"title":"Lovelight Chiffon Cake","body":"<p>We used this recipe for Sara's wedding.

It's very tasty, very easy, and can take some or all white whole wheat flour. I'm using weights here, as it's easier, when in Spain, to use the scale; we don't have measuring cups here.</p><p></p><p>For the topping: in each of 2 silicone bread pans, melt 25 g butter, sprinkle chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans are great), about 35 g brown sugar, crushed or chopped pineapple</p><p></p><p>In bowl with steep sides, mix for 2 minutes at medium speed:</p><p>225-240 g flour                  (1 3/4 c.;half or all whole wheat will work, though it will be a bit heavier)</p><p>225 g sugar                       (1 1/8 - 1 1/4 c. sugar)</p><p>75 g soft butter                  (1/3 c.) soft butter</p><p>2 1/2 t. baking powder</p><p>1 t. salt</p><p>160 ml milk                         (2/3 c. milk)</p><p></p><p>Add and mix for 2 more minutes:</p><p>1 egg</p><p>80 ml milk                            (1/3 c. milk)</p><p>1 t. vanilla (or, for lemon cake: 1/4 t. vanilla, 3/4 t. lemon extract)</p><p></p><p>These directions are for when you're making the regular cake. Adapt for upside-down cake. I'll note that our 2016 oven turns off when the timer runs out (and doesn't start unless the timer is set), so things don't go well if the cake is soupy in the middle and you decide to give it more time, but the timer has rung. I'd also say that this much batter in 2 loaf pans takes a long time to bake, but we didn't have a larger pan. We began with the temp set at about 6 o'clock; we turned it up when progress was slow, but I think it was slow because the oven had turned off. It got pretty brown before we decided the center was done enough. </p><p>Pour batter into prepared pans (grease and flour): 2 8 or 9\" rounds or 9 x 13 pan. Bake at 175-190 C or 375 (350 in the outdoor roaster oven is safer) for 25 minutes for rounds, probably 40 for 9 x 13, until golden, and wooden pick comes out clean.</p><p>In 2018 I tried doing upside down muffins, and it wasn't great. Though it made for less cake and more topping, something Jon approved of, the batter spilled from one, burning on the bottom of the oven, and some of the butter/sugar mix seeped out and burned, too. Lots of smoke. It might have worked in really big muffin tins, but the normal 1/2 cup size we had didn't go so well. The rest of the batter was in the red loaf pan, and it worked fine. Of course, we ate the muffins; we just didn't like all the smoke.</p><p></p><p>Notes from year four, Gisbert Rico: I baked two cakes, one in a long silicone loaf pan, the other in a saucepan.  I used 2 T. of the brown sugar granules they have here for each cake, and used 1 t. baking soda instead of baking powder. They took a lot longer to bake than I expected, close to double. I could have drained the pineapple less, as a little more liquid might have been good. Near the end I turn the top heat element off so the top wouldn't continue to brown. In the past we've turned the whipping cream into butter by mistake, and we wondered if doing it in a tall container contributed. So we used a wider bowl, covered with a fruteria plastic bag with a hole for the whip attachment. It worked well.</p><p></p><p>For Jon's birthday I made the cake in the oval terra cotta. I used about 50 g butter, 3 pineapple rings, chopped fine, 1/3 cup walnuts (could have been more), 4 T. coarse brown sugar. I added just a little more milk to the batter. Baked at 175 C 20 min, turn, 8 min, then turn off top element (and convection fan on) 10 more minutes. 5 more with top element on.</p><p></p><p>2019 Progreso piso: I baked in two pans from Dale and Aida, a pie place and a square pan. I did 25 g. melted butter in each, but they stuck, so I think going up to about 35 g. would be better. 2 T. brown sugar crystals scattered in each one, then about 1/3 cup chopped nuts in each, 2 T. coconut shreds in one. The cake itself had the first milk measure as coconut liquid from a can of coconut milk, unstirred, and and one egg, plus a little more egg from egg wash, less than a half-shell's worth. I used 1 t. baking soda, 1/2 t. cream of tartar, and a tablespoon of pineapple juice. Each pan had a ring and a half of pineapple, finely chopped. </p><p>We preheated to 160, approx, and I turned it up to 175 at some early point. The pans were hard to fit in the oven, sort of diagonal with the square in the back corner, the glass in front kitty corner. They baked for about 25 minutes, I think, though the timer didn't work for the second bit, so that's approximate. Things stuck when we turned them over. Perhaps parchment paper....</p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20140617","modified":"20190422"},"Pineapple Upside-down Banana Bread":{"title":"Pineapple Upside-down Banana Bread","body":"<p>An experiment in Valencia, 2017:</p><p>Mix:</p><p>140 g. ripe mashed banana</p><p>about 40 g. chopped fresh orange bits (1/4 small orange), optional (you could use a little pineapple juice instead)</p><p>1 T. lemon juice</p><p>45 g. sugar</p><p>45 g. oil</p><p>shy 1/2 t. vanilla</p><p></p><p>In the long red silicone loaf pan, melt:</p><p>25 g. salted butter.

So no top heat!]</p><p>More directions from Mark Bittman:</p><p>Cook until the rice plumps and starts to become a more noticeable part of the mixture and the skin becomes more visible and darker, about 30 minutes more. Now the pudding is getting close to done, so check on it every 10 minutes, stirring each time (it should reach the right texture in 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the kind of rice you used).</p><p>3. The pudding will be done before you think it’s done. The rice should be really swollen and the milk thickened considerably but still pretty fluid (it will thicken more as it cools). Serve warm, at room temperature, or cold.</p><p></p><p>Tips: </p><p>You’ve got to use white rice in this recipe, but you have some choices: Long-grain aromatic rice (like basmati or jasmine) will deliver the most delicate texture and fragrance. Short- or medium-grain white rice (like Arborio) will be more thick and chewy. Supermarket long-grain rices will be somewhere in between.</p><p></p><p>5 Ways to Change the Flavor:</p><p></p><p>1. Substitute coconut, soy, rice, or nut milk for the milk.</p><p>2. Stir in a piece or two of whole spice (cinnamon sticks, cloves, or nutmeg) at the beginning of cooking.</p><p>3.

Thai sweet black rice</p><p>2 c. water</p><p>put down a trivet, and add 1 1/2 c. water in the bottom, then with a foil strap lower in the bowl of rice and water.

There's a very short time between \"melted/caramelized just right\" and \"burnt\". I don't remember the exact process, because I haven't done it very often, but this is what I remember. It is a key part of the right taste, though.</p><p></p><p>When the edges start to liquify, swirl the pan around to encourage the melted parts to melt the unmelted parts. (Don't stir, though, or it just gets messed up.) When everything is completely melted, immediately remove it from the heat, and (carefully -- it may splatter) stir in heated liquid, which is probably the coconut milk, but may be just water.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p>","creator":"Lori","created":"20130221","modified":"20150506"},"Sweet Potato Felafel":{"title":"Sweet Potato Felafel","body":"<p>Type the text for 'Sweet Potato Falafel'</p><p></p><p>Baked Sweet Potato Falafel Recipe found through 101 cookbooks</p><p></p><p>These falafel are Leon's most popular veggie dish to date.

I made it today and we enjoyed it very much. It comes from this source: https://food52.com/recipes/71580-clotilde-dusoulier-s-yogurt-cake-gateau-au-yaourt</p><p></p><p>Today's cake had some variations, as follows:</p><p></p><p>1 cup plain yogurt 1.5% milkfat (about 8 ounces, 245 g.)</p><p>2 large eggs</p><p>160 grams sugar </p><p>1 envelope vanilla sugar</p><p>75 g vegetable oil </p><p>200 g spelt flour, a mix of whole spelt and spelt 630</p><p>1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, sifted</p><p>1/2 teaspoon baking soda, sifted</p><p>1 pinch salt (or more, between 1/4 and 1/2 t.)</p><p></p><p>Preheat oven to about 170 or 175 (350 F) Mix yogurt, eggs, sugar, vanilla sugar and oil together in a bowl. Separately, mix leavenings, salt and flours together, sifting out lumps. Fold dry mixture into wet, stirring to moistening, not overmixing (though spelt is lower in gluten, so it's not as much of a worry, I believe). Pour into a small non-stick bundt pan or 10\" round lined with parchment. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes until golden and wooden pick comes out clean. Cool in pan for 10 minutes then carefully loosen.</p><p></p><p>I thought I'd make a little drizzle with the last of the lime curd, some coconut cream and powdered sugar, but found that the powdered sugar-covered cake on the package was a ruse; I was using cornstarch. So Then we found the pulverzuker to sprinkle on the cake. It was very nice warm.</p><p></p><p>The second time we made this I did a pineapple upside down thing in the small bundt pan; 60 g melted butter, 1/4 cup sugar mixed with a drizzle of blackstrap molasses mixed well, and chopped walnuts, maybe a heaping 1/4 cup, and chopped pineapple, a bit drained, also a heaping quarter cup or so. I mixed the melted butter and sugar at the bottom, then laid in the nuts and pineapple, then poured the cake batter on top. we'll whip some cream and hope for the best.</p>","creator":"YourName","created":"20200418","modified":"20200425"},"Yogurt and Oats":{"title":"Yogurt and Oats","body":"<p>Mark likes to stir oats and yogurt together for a snack.

I've got a two quart glass casserole, and fill it with about 7 1/2 cups of milk and heat it on high for about 10 minutes, until a film forms on top of the milk. If you do it on the stove top, you may want to try a technique called icing the pan, to prevent scorching. Google can help you find it. It's explained in a book called //The Homemade Pantry. //</p><p>Once scalded, the milk needs to cool down to about 110 degrees, so it won't kill your start. Stir warm milk with yogurt start, and pour into clean jar (if you worry that it might not be sterile, you can rinse in a hot water/bit of bleach solution, then rinse. I usually trust that my dishwasher has done enough, and I can't remember having a problem). Set down into hot water in cooler. Repeat with other jars, if desired. Yogurt should be set in 6-8 hours. If you want to sweeten it, try 2 T. sugar, or 1 T. maple syrup plus 1 T. sugar.  </p><p></p><p>2020 yogurt in the round yogurt maker:</p><p></p><p>In two-quart glass measuring pitcher microwave 5 cups of whole milk for 5 min 30 seconds. Take out and put on a cooling rack, setting timer for about 25 minutes to see what the temp is. Once it's below 110, slowly whisk in 1 Tablespoon yogurt start (from previous batch, or commercial yogurt containing active cultures). Use the one-cup plastic measuring cup to dip in and fill 7 small jars, then place in the yogurt maker and cover. (You can leave the lids off if you like, or put them on. I've done it both ways.) Put the clear lid on, turned so the mark aligns with a time 6 to 8 hours in the future, to help you remember when the yogurt should be done.</p>","creator":"YourName","created":"20130305","modified":"20200430"},"Yogurt from Powdered Milk":{"title":"Yogurt from Powdered Milk","body":"<p>3 quart jars</p><p>3 plastic lids</p><p>small cooler</p><p>powdered milk</p><p>yogurt (at least 2-3T per quart)</p><p>mixing bowl (easy to pour from)</p><p>whisk</p><p>sugar (optional)</p><p></p><p># Fill cooler half way with hottest tap water; close lid</p><p># Fill jars 3/4 with hot water, 100-110 degrees (measure with instant-read thermometer -- 110 should be OK; 120 too hot)</p><p># In mixing bowl, add 2/3 c. fine milk powder, 2-3 heaping T yogurt, and hot water from one jar</p><p># Whisk carefully to not create too much foam</p><p># Pour mixture back into jar; close lid; put into cooler; close lid</p><p># Repeat with other two jars (for sweet yogurt, also add 2 T sugar)</p><p># Let sit 6-8 hours until set</p><p># Refrigerate</p>","creator":"JonF","created":"20100927","modified":"20130305"},"Yule Loaf":{"title":"Yule Loaf","body":"<p>This recipe my mom has made for many years as a birthday cake for Jesus.
